# 🧠 MLOps Mastery Roadmap (AWS-Focused, Production-Ready) – By Afsar Ahamed

## 🎯 Goal
Master end-to-end MLOps workflows tailored for high-paying roles — including deploying, scaling, monitoring, and governing ML systems in production using AWS and modern MLOps tooling.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: AWS MLOps Foundation

**🎓 Certification**
- [ ] AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty

**🛠️ Core AWS Tools**
- [ ] **SageMaker** – training, tuning, endpoints  
- [ ] **SageMaker Pipelines** – MLOps workflow orchestration  
- [ ] **S3, Lambda, Step Functions, CloudWatch** – storage, automation, observability  
- [ ] **Clarify & Model Monitor** – responsible AI, drift & bias tracking  

**📦 Project: Computer Vision MLOps Pipeline (AWS)**
- Train EfficientNet or YOLOv5
- Deploy using SageMaker Endpoints
- Set up monitoring with CloudWatch + Model Monitor
- Handle data drift and auto-alerting with Step Functions
