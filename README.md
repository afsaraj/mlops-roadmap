- [ ] SageMaker Clarify – bias/fairness analysis
- [ ] SageMaker Model Monitor – production monitoring

**📦 Project: Computer Vision MLOps Pipeline**
- Train a YOLOv5/EfficientNet model
- Deploy to SageMaker Endpoint
- Build a pipeline with monitoring, data drift detection
- Log metrics to CloudWatch

|------|-------|
| 🚢 **Containerization** | Docker |
| ☸️ **Orchestration** | Kubernetes, KubeFlow, Helm |
| 🔁 **Pipelines** | MLflow, Airflow, Prefect, Dagster |
| 🧪 **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow, Weights & Biases (W&B), Neptune.ai |
| ⚙️ **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins |
| 🔒 **IaC (Infra as Code)** | Terraform, AWS CDK, CloudFormation |
| 📈 **Monitoring & Logging** | Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Loki |
| 🧠 **Model Serving** | SageMaker, BentoML, FastAPI, TorchServe |
| 🧬 **Model Versioning** | DVC, MLflow Registry, S3 with metadata |
| 🤖 **Responsible AI** | SageMaker Clarify, Fairlearn, Aequitas |
| 🧠 **Feature Stores** | Feast, SageMaker Feature Store |

**📦 Project: MLflow + FastAPI + Prometheus + Grafana**
- Train and log experiments via MLflow
- Serve model via FastAPI (containerized)
- Track metrics with Prometheus
- Visualize & alert with Grafana

---

## 📍 Phase 3: Real-World Projects (Showcase & Learn)

**📁 Project 1: End-to-End Computer Vision MLOps (AWS + Open Source Tools)**
- Dataset ingestion → Model training → Deployment → CI/CD → Monitoring
- Tools: SageMaker, Docker, MLflow, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana

**📁 Project 2: NLP or Tabular Pipeline**
- Hugging Face model or Scikit-learn on tabular data
- Serving with BentoML, tracked with W&B

**📁 Project 3: Drift-Aware Auto-Retraining Pipeline**
- Use SageMaker Model Monitor or custom drift detection
- Trigger retraining via Lambda + Step Functions

**📝 Deliverables**
- [ ] Clean README (usecase, architecture diagram, setup, results)
- [ ] Live API/app (e.g., Streamlit, FastAPI, SageMaker Endpoint)
- [ ] Grafana dashboard screenshot
- [ ] CI/CD workflow YAML
- [ ] Medium/Dev.to blog post or case study

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Cloud Expansion & Enterprise Readiness

**Optional Cloud Certs**
- [ ] GCP Professional ML Engineer (Vertex AI, TFX, Kubeflow)
- [ ] Azure AI Engineer Associate (Azure ML, AutoML, ACI)

**Optional Add-ons**
- [ ] Data versioning with DVC
- [ ] Model card generation with `model-card-toolkit`
- [ ] Data quality checks with Great Expectations
- [ ] Real-time deployment with Kafka + Faust (for stream inference)

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Personal Branding & Career Launch

**🧾 Portfolio Checklist**
- [ ] GitHub projects (3+ with great READMEs)
- [ ] Blog posts (1 per project, technical depth)
- [ ] Portfolio site or Notion dashboard
- [ ] LinkedIn summary update with MLOps tech stack

**💼 Target Roles**
